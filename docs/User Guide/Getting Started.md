## 🔐 Connect Your Discord Bot

Before your bot can go live, you’ll need to connect it to Discord:

1. Open the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Create a **new application** and add a **bot user**
3. Enable all **Privileged Gateway Intents** (Presence, Server Members, Message Content)
4. Copy your **Bot Token**
5. Open LocalBotify and paste the token in:
   `Settings → Token`

> ⚠️ **Important:** Never share your bot token.
> 🔒 Use `Environment Encryption` in LocalBotify to help protect your credentials from token stealers or malware.

## ⚙️ Configure Your Bot

Now that your bot is connected, it’s time to personalize it:

* **🟢 Status & Presence**
  Set your bot’s activity (e.g. "Playing Music", "Watching Commands", etc.)

* **⌨️ Prefix & Commands**
  Choose how users interact with the bot (`!help`, `/help`, or custom prefixes)

* **🎨 Embeds & Messages**
  Customize embed colors, footers, welcome messages, and more

## ▶️ Going Live

Once you're ready:

1. Click the **Run** button inside LocalBotify
